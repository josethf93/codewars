Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

SOLUTION:
def disemvowel(string):
    c = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    
    for x in c:
        string = string.replace(x,'')
        
    for x in c:
        d = (x.upper())
        string = string.replace(d,'')

    return string
    
OTHER SOLUTIONS:
def disemvowel(s):
    return s.translate(None, "aeiouAEIOU")

def disemvowel(s):
    for i in "aeiouAEIOU":
        s = s.replace(i,'')
    return s
