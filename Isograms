An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
is_isogram("aba" ) == false
is_isogram("moOse" ) == false # -- ignore letter case
#FUNDAMENTALS  #STRINGS

#Solution is a work im progress
def is_isogram(string):
    su = string.upper()
    c = "0"
    for x in su:
            if su.count(x) > 1:
                c = "1"
                break
    
    if c == 0:
        print ("True")
    else:
        print ("False") 
        
    #Python Identity Operators
    #Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
    return ("0" in c)
